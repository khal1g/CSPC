# CSPC Computer Science for Physics and Chemistry
My coursework repository. Each practical is under PW<n>/Lab <X>/.

## Setup
Create the environment for a given lab:
```bash
conda env create -f PW<n>/Lab\ <X>/environment.yml
conda activate cspc

PW1

Lab A: Reproducible Foundations

What I built:
Set up the lab repository structure, configured the Conda environment, integrated decay simulation algorithms, added unit tests with pytest, and measured performance speedup of NumPy vectorization.

Speed comparison (loop vs NumPy):

    loop: 3.0855 s

    numpy: 0.0002 s

    speed-up: 12485.47x faster

Tests: all passing? yes

Conclusion:
Using Conda ensures complete environment reproducibility across machines. Vectorizing operations with NumPy dramatically speeds up calculations compared to Python loops. Unit testing with pytest verifies physical validity.
